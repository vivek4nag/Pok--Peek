Welcome to **Poke Card Quest** – where every flip takes you deeper into the world of Pokémon! 🌍🔍 Powered by the PokeAPI, this app is your ticket to discovering all the Pokémon out there in style. Get ready to embark on an epic quest of power, stats, and hidden surprises!

## What is Poke Card Quest? 🎮
Think of it as your personal Pokédex, but cooler. With Poke Card Quest, you can:
- **Flip** through cards of every Pokémon you can imagine (and probably some you can’t).
- **Reveal hidden stats** and powers, making you the ultimate Pokémon master (or at least sound like one).
- **Ooh and ahh** over the sleek loading shimmer effect – because who doesn’t love a good shimmer while waiting?

## Features 📋
- **Epic Shimmer Loading**: A fancy shimmer effect to entertain you while the magic happens.✨
- **Detailed Power Stats**: Get to know each Pokémon’s unique strengths and weaknesses. No more guessing!
- **Card Flip Animation**: Hover or tap to reveal the Pokémon’s secrets. 🔄
- **Smooth UI**: Built with a dash of style and a sprinkle of love. 💖

## How It Works 🛠️
Using the PokeAPI, this app fetches Pokémon data and presents it in beautifully designed cards. When the data is loading, you'll see a shimmering placeholder to keep things lively. Once loaded, just hover over the cards to flip and reveal each Pokémon’s superpowers and stats.

## Ready to Begin? 🏆
Why just catch 'em all when you can **flip 'em all**? Join the **Poke Card Quest** and dive into the world of Pokémon like never before! 🔥
